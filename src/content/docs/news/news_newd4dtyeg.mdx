We've just released **ClassFlow v0.1.1** with a handy new feature based on early user feedback!

## What's New

## Improvements

- Added quick class switcher to the main navigation
- Improved app launch time on older devices
- Fixed a minor UI glitch in the assignment view
- Enhanced VoiceOver descriptions for better accessibility

## Update Now

Head to AltStore and update ClassFlow to get these improvements. As always, your feedback helps shape the future of ClassFlow - keep it coming!

Thanks for using ClassFlow!
