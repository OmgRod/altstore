We've just released **ClassFlow v0.2.0** with some handy new features!

## What's New

This update fixes tons of deprecation warnings and makes the backend code way tidier!

## Improvements

- Created reusable component library to reduce code duplication
- Fixed file selection for good (I think)
- Fixed all deprecation warnings
- Removed scanner on desktop
- Add "Don't show this again" in the tutorial modal (may be a bit broken for now)

## Update Now

Head to AltStore and update ClassFlow to get these improvements. As always, your feedback helps shape the future of ClassFlow - keep it coming!

Thanks for using ClassFlow!
